Pleaase ensure you are operating out of the N. Virginia (us-east-1) region.
NOTE: The lab shows the attaching policies to AWS users; in the real world, we would want to administer from the group level whenever possible. 
AWS now auto logs out when logging in as another user (even if in a new Incognito/Private Window). As a work around, you can right-click the 
lab's blue "Open Link in Incognito/Private Window` button and copy the link into a different browser. You'll then be able to be logged into the other 
account using the lab provided credentials. The lab is easiest to do with 3 different browsers due to the new AWS logout behaviour.
